### Patch Changes

- [#1607](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1607) [`5beb3ce`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/5beb3ced84758f4255356f1118442a45ecaa01b6) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Reintroduce the starter picker for empty entries.

  The Puck-removal refactor ([#1143](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/issues/1143)) dropped the "Pick a starter…" onboarding shown
  when authoring a blank entry, so new entries opened onto an empty canvas with no
  offered starting points — even though the pattern data layer still marked
  starter-eligible patterns (`target: "post-content"`, optional `entryTypes`,
  `priority`). The bespoke editor now surfaces them again:

  - `PlumixEditor` takes an `entryType` and, for a blank entry, opens a modal of
    the eligible starter patterns (ordered by priority) plus a "Start from blank"
    escape. Choosing one seeds the canvas with the pattern's blocks (fresh ids, a
    single undoable step); the editor stays empty on "Start from blank".
  - A toolbar "Pick a starter…" button re-summons the picker while the canvas is
    still empty, so a dismissal isn't final.

  Starter open state lives in the editor store; the read-only revision preview
  omits the picker.

- [#1605](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1605) [`154e9e4`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/154e9e44c538a8a89056f6be6c5e6fbb1d305c36) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Restore the browse-revision-history button in the visual editor.

  The Puck-removal refactor ([#1143](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/issues/1143)) left the bespoke `PlumixEditor` header with no
  slot for the revision-history affordance, so `edit.tsx` stopped wiring it for the
  visual branch — revision history became reachable only by hand-crafting a
  `?revision=<id>` URL. `PlumixEditor` (and its header) now take an optional
  `revisionsTrigger` slot, rendered as a history icon just after undo/redo, and the
  visual editor route wires `useRevisionsTrigger` into it — mirroring the plain-form
  editor (which keeps its labelled text button via the sheet's `triggerVariant`).
  The sheet's orpc calls stay in the app; the package only exposes the slot.

### Patch Changes

- [#1553](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1553) [`011174b`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/011174b37b3015b033191e72426c5b7849c33df2) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Polish the repeater row editor and fix a data-loss bug in its summary rail.

  - **New `repeater(...).dialogSize("sm" | "md" | "lg")`** sets the row-editor
    dialog width (`sm:max-w-lg` / `sm:max-w-2xl` / `sm:max-w-4xl`; default `md`).
    Widen it for dense, multi-column rows. Threaded core builder → manifest →
    admin like the existing `.layout()` / `.collapsed()` hints.
  - **Data loss on add / remove / reorder after editing a row is fixed.** The
    summary rail read the parent Controller's snapshot, which doesn't re-render
    when a subfield is edited inside the row dialog; the next structural change
    then committed an array missing the just-edited row's values. It now reads
    the live array via `useWatch`.
  - **Row-editor dialog no longer breaks layout when a field shows a validation
    message** — the grid stretched every sibling cell to the errored field's
    height and vertically centered their controls out of line; cells now
    top-align.
  - **Toggle fields render label-above** like every other grid field, so a
    toggle sharing a row with text / number inputs aligns on the input midline
    instead of floating at the siblings' label height.
  - The summary row's **Edit control is now an icon-only button** (was a
    text button that turned red on error); error state is conveyed solely by the
    warning indicator, and destructive styling is reserved for the remove button.
    Its accessible name is row-numbered ("Edit row 3") so a screen reader can
    tell the rows apart.
