## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1536](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1536) [`b7f3810`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/b7f3810be8e72ba44d05f74fb663dec3c6cb906a) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Enforces every declarative field constraint server-side through one generic walker over the field definitions, and addresses write rejections to the exact field (breaking, pre-1.0). The per-value pipeline is now coercion → `.sanitize()` (typed transform) → declarative constraints → `.validate()` (sync or async, `true` or an i18n-able message — executed for the first time). The walker covers required (previously a UI-only promise), `maxLength`, numeric and temporal bounds (temporal previously UI-only, now with stored-shape format checks), option membership and selection counts, row counts, and email/url/color/link format checks — replacing the per-factory hand-injected sanitizers on `range`, `color`, `select`, `link`, `richtext`, and `repeater`, so `.sanitize()` is purely the author's transform and can no longer disable a declared constraint. Failures aggregate across the whole patch into `CONFLICT.data.errors` as `{ path, message }` pairs — `path` dot-joins into nested repeater cells (`sections.2.heading`), `message` is a plain string or a message descriptor with its interpolation values — and the admin metabox form pins each onto the addressed input inline (term edit, user edit, and the entry editor's document panel). `sanitizeMetaInput`/`sanitizeMetaForRpc` are now async; sanitize callbacks that throw map to a path-addressed generic invalid error instead of carrying custom reasons (use `.validate()` for custom messages).

- [#1534](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1534) [`40d4221`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/40d4221e6f880e7bc653ff948adc339f06a78d4b) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Adds conditional field visibility authored from field references: condition factories typed per driving field (`.is()`, `.gt()`, `.isOn()`, containment/count on multi-select) feed `.visibleWhen()`/`.orVisibleWhen()` groups that show/hide admin fields live and skip server-side validation of hidden fields.

- [#1529](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1529) [`3171824`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/3171824efeebd85a89ae2edcac86c7a379cc8b5f) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - New `link()` field on `plumix/fields`: a fluent CTA-shaped value (`{ url, label?, newTab? }`) with the full universal chain and phantom `LinkValue | undefined` typing (narrowed by `.required()`/`.default()`). The value's shape and URL are server-validated on write (site-relative path or WHATWG-parseable absolute URL; unknown properties stripped) ahead of any chained `.sanitize()`. The admin metabox control authors the URL by typing an external URL or picking a public internal entry — resolved to its permalink via the lookup RPC — with a link-text input and an open-in-new-tab switch.

- [#1532](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1532) [`1501f42`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/1501f42f2431290f5ecdfbe35035948c90733511) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Fluent field builders, part two (breaking, pre-1.0): the remaining eight scalar field constructors on `plumix/fields` — `number`, `range`, `date`, `datetime`, `time`, `color`, `richtext`, `json` — now author as immutable chained builders instead of flat option objects: `number("rating").min(1).max(5).step(0.5)`, `richtext("body").marks(["bold"]).nodes(["heading"])`. Per-type chains expose only the options that apply (`number(...).maxLength(...)` is a compile error); `range` requires `.min()`/`.max()` and enforces `min <= max` at registration; `color` and `range` keep their injected default sanitizers (a custom `.sanitize()` replaces them); `richtext` always injects the allowlist walker and deliberately offers no `.sanitize()`. Removed: the flat `NumberFieldOptions`/`RangeFieldOptions`/`DateFieldOptions`/`DateTimeFieldOptions`/`TimeFieldOptions`/`ColorFieldOptions`/`RichtextFieldOptions`/`JsonFieldOptions` types; `DateMetaBoxField`/`DateTimeMetaBoxField`/`TimeMetaBoxField` are now aliases of `TemporalMetaBoxField<I>`.

  New: `.returns("date")` on `date`/`datetime`/`time` projects the stored ISO string to a JS `Date` at decode time and the inferred read type follows (`Date | undefined`, narrowed by `.required()`/`.default()`); the default read stays the ISO string. Projected `Date`s anchor their wall-clock components to UTC (`date` at UTC midnight, `time` on 1970-01-01 UTC) so they survive any server/browser timezone split — read components back with `getUTC*` or `timeZone: "UTC"` formatting. Symmetrically, temporal fields now accept a `Date` on the write side and store the field's ISO shape from UTC components, so admin round-trips of projected values are lossless; `formatTemporalValue` on `@plumix/core/manifest` exposes the shared formatter.

- [#1531](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1531) [`c067480`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/c067480cb8ecb70d1be2a0ad6f26634bd919a2fd) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Consolidates choice fields onto a fluent `select()` builder and adds `toggle()` (breaking, pre-1.0). `select("size").options(["s", "m"])` infers the option literal union as the value type; `.multiple()` flips reads to a readonly array and storage to a JSON array, unlocking selection-count `.max()`; `.appearance("select" | "radio" | "buttons" | "checkboxes")` picks the admin control without changing the value shape, and cardinality-illegal combinations are compile errors in either call order. `toggle()` renders the admin switch with `.onText()`/`.offText()` state labels and reads `boolean | undefined`, narrowed by `.required()`/`.default()`. Removes the flat `radio`, `multiselect`, and `checkbox` factories, their option types, and their wire variants — object literals using the retired `inputType` strings still compile via `LegacyMetaBoxField` and still render. `SelectMetaBoxField` becomes a `multiple`/`type`-correlated union, and the manifest wire carries `multiple`, `appearance`, `onText`, and `offText`.

- [#1527](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1527) [`274a97c`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/274a97c0c239ba1722965b00620e1ad91b54ef90) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Fluent field builders (breaking, pre-1.0): the five string scalar field constructors on `plumix/fields` — `text`, `textarea`, `email`, `url`, `password` — now author as immutable chained builders instead of flat option objects: `text("subtitle").placeholder("…").maxLength(120)` replaces `text({ key, label, … })`. Labels default to the humanized key; the universal chain adds `.label()` (string or message descriptor), `.description()`, `.placeholder()`, `.prepend()`/`.append()`, `.default()`, `.required()`, `.span()`, `.capability()`, `.showInApi()`, `.sanitize()`, and `.validate()`, with phantom value typing (`string | undefined`, narrowed to `string` by `.required()`/`.default()`). Every `fields` registration surface (entry/term/user meta boxes, settings groups, repeater `subFields`) accepts builders alongside plain field definitions and compiles them at registration. `.span()` is accepted on every surface as a universal layout hint — the `EntryMetaBoxField` span-omit union is gone (the entry editor rail still ignores and strips the hint). Removed: the flat `TextFieldOptions`/`TextareaFieldOptions`/`EmailFieldOptions`/`UrlFieldOptions`/`PasswordFieldOptions` types; the five per-variant field interfaces are now aliases of `StringMetaBoxField<I>`. Repeater rows no longer feed absent (`null`/omitted) subfield values into sanitize callbacks, mirroring top-level deletion semantics.

- [#1538](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1538) [`9087ed0`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/9087ed0c9dfc720b5b3b135691bade4a9afbe28d) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Read-time reference hydration is now cache-correct: a page that embeds a referenced entity carries that entity's cache tag and is purged when the entity changes. A per-request accumulator collects tags during hydration and the public read-through folds them into the page's stored cache tags, so editing, deleting, or otherwise changing an embedded entry busts the pages that hydrated it (the entry adapter contributes its precise `e:<id>` tag through the existing purge pipeline). Lookup adapters gain an optional `embeddedCacheTags(payload)` method to declare the tag a hydrated payload contributes; kinds without a per-entity purge identity (e.g. `user`) omit it. A new server-side `hydrateReferences(ctx, kind, ids, { scope })` helper gives themes the same batched adapter path and tag accounting for id-only reference fields, resolving an id set in one in-query per chunk and returning the hydrated payloads dense and in requested order. Pages that hydrate nothing are tagged exactly as before.

- [#1535](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1535) [`63afd4f`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/63afd4f2a3f5e8197ba26b9145b75e52a548b61b) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Reference meta fields hydrate at read time (breaking, pre-1.0). Lookup adapters gain an optional batched `hydrate({ ids, scope })` contract; core's `entry`/`term`/`user` adapters resolve ids into public-safe summary shapes (`EntryReferenceSummary` with title/slug/url, `TermReferenceSummary`, `UserReferenceSummary` — never email/role), and the media adapter resolves a full media item including its URL, so themes can finally render a media meta field. Hydrated shapes are declared per kind in the merged `ReferenceHydrationShapes` registry, augmentable by plugins. The read pipeline (`hydrateMetaBags`, replacing `filterMetaOrphans`) runs hydration and orphan-stripping as one traversal: ids aggregate across all reference fields of all entries in a response and resolve with one in-query per `(kind, scope)` group — public render template data, admin oRPC reads, and REST projection all return hydrated values. Hydration is one level deep (a hydrated entry's own references stay ids), deleted referenced entities read as absent (single refs `null`, multi refs dropped, arrays stay dense), and kinds whose adapter predates `hydrate` keep the plain-id read shape. Unpublished referenced entries are clamped away from viewers without `edit_any` on the referenced type, so public render and anonymous REST never leak a draft's title through hydration. Hydrated values round-trip safely through writes — the sanitizer and the autosave merge heal `{ id, ... }` payloads back to plain ids. Admin reference pickers accept the hydrated object values and keep operating on ids.

- [#1530](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1530) [`a55a17c`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/a55a17cfb577b8e5f21b428496bd2a0d76b9fffd) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Typed meta reads (breaking, pre-1.0): declared fields now flow into typed reads everywhere via contribution-keyed registries. Augment `EntryMetaContributions` / `TermMetaContributions` / `UserMetaContributions` (keyed by box id) or `SettingsContributions` (keyed by group name) with `{ entryTypes: "post"; fields: typeof myFields }`, and `MetaOf<K>` / `TermMetaOf<K>` / `UserMetaOf` / `SettingsOf<Name>` fold every contribution targeting `K` into one closed record — a mistyped field name is a compile error in the theme. Targeted templates (`forEntryType(...)`, `forTermTaxonomy(...)`) receive entries and terms with the folded typed `meta` (`ResolvedEntryFor<K>` / `ResolvedTermFor<K>`), and `whereMeta` keys/values are typed against the distinct stored shapes (`StoredMetaOf<K>` / `StoredTermMetaOf<K>` via `InferStoredFields` — `.default()` narrows only the read shape). When a contribution declaration exists for a box id, the matching `register*` call is typechecked against it (target set and fields must match); a missing declaration degrades to absence from the typed record and can be supplied from any package via interface merging. Removed: the `meta` projection slot on `EntryTypeRegistry` / `TermTaxonomyRegistry` — `MetaOf`/`TermMetaOf` no longer read it and no longer fall back to an open `Record<string, unknown>`, so `whereMeta` on a type with no declared contributions accepts no keys.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1479](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1479) [`ff1d101`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/ff1d1011486e4de0a97c29acd1de33330299dd6f) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Add an entry-editor template picker for theme-registered `named` templates. A theme exposes author-selectable templates via `forEntryType("page").named("landing", "Landing Page").template(...)` (shipped in [#1445](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/issues/1445)); this wires up the missing producer so authors can actually choose one.

  - The editor's Page tab shows a "Template" picker listing the `named` templates registered for the current entry type, plus a "(theme default)" option. The pick is written to the reserved `__plumix_template` entry-meta key via a new first-class `template` field on `entry.update` (`null` clears it) — it bypasses the plugin meta-box sanitizer, which still rejects the reserved key on the `meta` path.
  - The set of named templates per type is surfaced to the precompiled admin through the manifest (`collectNamedTemplates` → `buildManifest` options → `EntryTypeManifestEntry.namedTemplates`), never a direct theme import.
  - The preview overlay now keeps `__plumix_template` when stripping reserved autosave meta, so an unsaved pick drives the preview render. A published entry's saved choice resolves to its template on the public route.

- [#1487](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1487) [`a69b39e`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/a69b39e2d909f21cb59c287e4a3e90f83e1e9392) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Add the telemetry consumer contract and split the collection gate off the debug bar. A site operator registers consumers once in app config and receives a JSON-serializable snapshot of every sampled request post-response:

  ```ts
  plumix({
    telemetry: {
      consumers: [
        {
          id: "my-exporter",
          sample: (ctx) => Math.random() < 0.1, // head-sampling; omitted = always
          onRequestEnd: async (snapshot, ctx) => {
            /* envelope + span tree + records + dropped counters */
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  });
  ```

  - The collector core is now always present in production bundles and activates per request iff at least one registered consumer votes yes — with no consumers it stays the no-op and production pays nothing. The debug-bar UI remains dev-only and dead-code-eliminated; in dev it registers as the first consumer.
  - `TelemetrySnapshot` carries a request envelope (`requestId`, `method`, `url`, `status`, `startedAt`, `durationMs`), root spans, timestamped records by namespace, and dropped counters. Delivery rides `ctx.defer` — `waitUntil` on the Cloudflare adapter — so export I/O never blocks the response; a 500 still delivers its snapshot.
  - New public types from `@plumix/core`: `TelemetryConsumer`, `TelemetrySnapshot`, `TelemetryRequestEnvelope`, `TelemetryConfig` (plus the existing span/record types are now exported).
  - The collector no longer source-drops namespaces for disabled debug-bar panels — panel disable stays a render-time filter; data collection is consumer-owned.

- [#1490](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1490) [`5776069`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/5776069d17ae9370c4a82c13f57150dfdf409009) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Unifies automatic DB query tracing: every query flowing through `ctx.db` — libsql, D1, the demo runtime, and statements inside transactions — now appears in the telemetry snapshot as one `db: <kind>` span with `db.sql`, `db.params` (lazy, JSON-safe), and `db.rows` attributes, regardless of whether core or a plugin issued it.

  - One wrap at client construction per driver: `traceSqlClient` (libsql `execute`/`batch`/`transaction`), a new `traceD1Client` in the Cloudflare runtime (prepared statements, batches, and drizzle's emulated begin/commit transactions — timed for the first time), and the demo Durable-Object proxy callbacks. Batches are one round-trip and one span, carrying per-statement sql/params under `db.batch` and the summed row count.
  - Tracing is unconditional — no `PLUMIX_DEV` gate. Without an active collector (no consumer sampled the request) every span is a pass-through no-op, so production without telemetry consumers pays nothing; with a prod consumer registered, query spans now flow to it.
  - The drizzle-logger half of the old dual mechanism is deleted: `createDebugSqlLogger` is gone from `@plumix/core`, and the Database debug-bar panel renders from query spans (now with per-query durations) instead of the removed record channel. New shared helpers `traceDbQuery`/`traceDbBatch` are exported for runtime adapters.
  - DB connections not obtained from `ctx.db` remain an untraced platform boundary.

Core never learns about any specific feature; the seam is reusable by any future Durable Object, queue, or realtime adapter.

  The `auth.session` procedure now resolves the current user through the configured authenticator instead of a hardcoded session cookie, so custom authenticators (SSO, the demo sandbox) report the signed-in user on boot. The default cookie-backed behavior is unchanged.

  owns it as `theme.css` and ships it in `dist`; plumix's per-plugin CSS sidecar
  reads it from the installed admin package instead of keeping its own hand-synced
  copy. No public API change.
