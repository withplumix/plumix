# @plumix/core

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#1360](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1360) [`c37b6db`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/c37b6dba1913322aabc85e9b2876b433efe73351) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Accept same-origin requests in the RPC/auth CSRF origin check. The check compared the request `Origin` against the canonical `app.origin` (from `auth.passkey.origin`); a deploy served on a different host than its configured origin — including the demo sandbox, whose origin varies per deploy — failed with `csrf_origin_mismatch` on every admin request. A request whose `Origin` equals the host it targets is not cross-site forgery, so it now passes the origin check. The `X-Plumix-Request` header gate remains the primary CSRF defense, and cross-origin requests are still rejected.

- [#1358](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1358) [`17658a5`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/17658a53b3fb2f5135527a6f6a195f8c5aa49756) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Add a `virtual:plumix/worker-exports` codegen seam so a runtime adapter can contribute named exports — such as a Durable Object class — to the generated Cloudflare worker via `RuntimeAdapter.workerExports`. Core never learns about any specific feature; the seam is reusable by any future Durable Object, queue, or realtime adapter.

  The `auth.session` procedure now resolves the current user through the configured authenticator instead of a hardcoded session cookie, so custom authenticators (SSO, the demo sandbox) report the signed-in user on boot. The default cookie-backed behavior is unchanged.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#1333](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1333) [`b493fbb`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/b493fbb4b3cefec54322ea54023129b4ce1d1139) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - `r2()` and `images()` now resolve their configuration from the per-request env
  by convention, so a Cloudflare deploy's `plumix.config.ts` stays declarative
  instead of reading `process.env` at module load (which is empty on Workers).

  - `r2({ binding })` reads S3 presigned-upload credentials (`CF_ACCOUNT_ID`,
    `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `<BINDING>_BUCKET`) and
    `publicUrlBase` (`<BINDING>_PUBLIC_URL_BASE`) from the request env when the
    corresponding config slots are omitted. Explicit config always wins;
    presigned uploads stay disabled until all four credentials are present.
  - `images()` is now callable with no arguments and gains an optional
    `connect(env)` step, resolving its zone from `MEDIA_PUBLIC_URL_BASE` at
    request time and passing sources through untouched until that host is set.
  - `@plumix/core`'s `ImageDelivery` interface gains an optional `connect(env)`
    so runtimes can bind env-time image configuration.

  Backward compatible: existing explicit `r2({ ..., s3, publicUrlBase })` and
  `images({ zone })` configs are unchanged.
