## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#1520](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1520) [`902a922`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/902a922b8dc5652700cc9cbbb8f00726b34a482c) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Repeated reads dedupe within a request through a new request-scoped read-through memo on `ctx` (`ctx.memo`, plus a `memoBatch` helper for per-id memoization over one batched query). The hot single-row lookups now read through it inside the existing service functions: the `site` settings group (head defaults, SEO surfaces, and the settings template dep share one query), author rows in `buildResolvedEntries`, the entry-type probe (new shared `readEntryType`, deduping the comments template dep against the blog related-posts loader), and the menu query cluster (shared between the `menus` template dep and `getMenuForLocation`, which now rides `ctx.memo` instead of a bespoke WeakMap). `plumix/test` gains `createTracedContext` and `createRequestMemo` for query-count assertions and `AppContext` stand-ins.
