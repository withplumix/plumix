### Patch Changes

- [#1731](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/1731) [`c5facfe`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/c5facfee050d3f5880de31dc6866dd48c4ac3d41) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Augment the public `plumix` specifier instead of the `plumix/plugin` subpath.

  These plugins declared their `TemplateDepRegistry`, `ReferenceHydrationShapes`,
  `FilterRegistry`, `ActionRegistry`, and `AppContextExtensions` contributions via
  `declare module "plumix/plugin"`. A theme augmenting a registry through the root
  `plumix` specifier (the documented convention, [#1691](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/issues/1691)) would not co-merge with a
  `plumix/plugin` augmentation of the same interface — declaration merging
  fractures across specifiers, dropping one side's keys. All augmentations now
  target `declare module "plumix"` so themes and plugins share one merged view.

  No runtime or public-API change: the plugins' value imports still come from
  `plumix/plugin`, and consumers read the contributed kinds through the same
  `defineTemplate` / reference-field surfaces as before.
