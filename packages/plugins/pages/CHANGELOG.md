### Patch Changes

- [#2010](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/2010) [`d9cb874`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/d9cb87447fd859a1d940dd8ce990571b79b88469) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Declares the locales each plugin actually ships catalogs for. These five ship
  `ar`/`de`/`uk`/`zh-CN` translations, but their `i18n` slot still named only the
  source locale (`pages` named `en` and `de`), so `buildManifest` projected an empty
  catalog map, omitted the plugin from `pluginI18n`, and never staged a file — a site
  installing the plugin from npm and enabling `ar`, `de`, `uk`, or `zh-CN` got English
  admin chrome in those locales. The translations landed in [#818](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/issues/818)/[#819](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/issues/819)/[#822](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/issues/822)/[#823](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/issues/823), which
  widened each plugin's `lingui.config.ts` but not the manifest slot;
  `@plumix/plugin-comments` and `@plumix/plugin-og` declared the full set from the
  start and are unaffected. En-only sites see no change either way: a declared locale
  the site has not enabled is intersected out before any URL is emitted.

- [#2009](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/pull/2009) [`17fa3cc`](https://github.com/withplumix/plumix/commit/17fa3cc4c852a6590bd72696cf535b76adbf4344) Thanks [@nasyrov](https://github.com/nasyrov)! - Ships each plugin's compiled Lingui catalogs in the published tarball. Every one
  of these plugins declares an `i18n` slot pointing at `./locales`, which the
  plumix Vite plugin copies out of the installed package at build time — but
  `package.json#files` allowlisted only `dist`, so the directory was absent from
  the tarball and a site installing the plugin from npm failed `plumix build` with
  `adminAssetNotFound`. Inside this repo a plugin resolves to a symlinked source
  tree, where the catalogs are always present, which is why nothing caught it.
