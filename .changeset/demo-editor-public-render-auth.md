Fix the visual editor being unusable under the Cloudflare demo runtime (and behind any non-cookie authenticator). Public-route renders only loaded the signed-in user when the standard `plumix_session` cookie was present, so a session established by a different signal — the demo's `plumix_demo` cookie, or Cloudflare Access's JWT header — rendered as anonymous. That left the editor's canvas iframe without its runtime, so blocks couldn't be selected, inserted, edited, or moved and the canvas wouldn't pan. Authenticators can now declare an optional `hasSession(request)` predicate so public renders recognise their sessions; the built-in demo and Cloudflare Access guards implement it. Also stops the demo toolbar pill from leaking into the editor canvas.
