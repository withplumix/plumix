Render the metabox `richtext()` field as a real Tiptap editor instead of a raw-JSON textarea.

The block editor's rich-text editor is now shared: it gained a JSON serialization mode (reads/writes the ProseMirror doc the field stores) and an optional marks/nodes allowlist that constrains both the editor schema and the toolbar, so a field authored with `.marks(["bold","link"]).nodes(["heading"])` only offers — and can only produce — the formatting it declares. The block editor's own usage is unchanged (HTML serialization and the full toolbar remain its defaults). The editor is code-split, so forms without a richtext field never load the ProseMirror chunk.

Also fixes the server-side richtext validator to implicitly allow `hardBreak` and `listItem`: the shared editor always ships a Shift+Enter line break, and any allowed list carries list items, so a natural `.nodes(["bulletList"])` field could previously produce content its own editor offered but the server then rejected on save.
