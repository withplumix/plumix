New `link()` field on `plumix/fields`: a fluent CTA-shaped value (`{ url, label?, newTab? }`) with the full universal chain and phantom `LinkValue | undefined` typing (narrowed by `.required()`/`.default()`). The value's shape and URL are server-validated on write (site-relative path or WHATWG-parseable absolute URL; unknown properties stripped) ahead of any chained `.sanitize()`. The admin metabox control authors the URL by typing an external URL or picking a public internal entry — resolved to its permalink via the lookup RPC — with a link-text input and an open-in-new-tab switch.
