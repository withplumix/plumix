The entry lookup-adapter scope can now express a status constraint (`scope: { entryTypes, status: "published" }`), pushed into the adapter's own `WHERE`. The menu resolver's published pre-filter query is gone — entry refs resolve in a single batched read instead of two back-to-back queries over the same ids on every public render. The admin picker keeps the current default (no status constraint, drafts admitted).
